Build political platform that maximizes number of voters for a candidate.

Questionnaire that lists 20 hot topics/candidate information.  Each person is asked to rank them from most important to least important in whom they vote for. 
They are also asked to rate specific actions for each topic on a scale of 1 to 5 on how much they supported the action/how strongly they felt about it, and how likely that would impact their vote.
